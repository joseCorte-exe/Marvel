##

Here's why:
* This project was built for an test to an interprise,
* but, this made me learn more about next, tool that i never use before
* but i think i made this project  :smile:


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

<!-- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
